## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project enforces a consistent homepage across all devices within an organization by using registry-based browser policies.  
It ensures that both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome open to a specified homepage on startup and display a Home button that leads to the same page.  

The script uses Windows PowerShell to modify **HKLM** registry keys under the **Policies** path, which applies settings to all users on the machine. When deployed via an automation tool such as **NinjaOne**, it runs as `SYSTEM` and guarantees persistence across logins and reboots.

---

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These steps will help you set up and deploy the script in a management environment.

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later  
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer  
- Administrator or SYSTEM permissions (for HKLM access)  
- (Optional) NinjaOne or another RMM tool for automation

### Installing
Clone or download the PowerShell script to your system or automation repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/rubenmunoz/Set-Homepage-Policy.git
```

Open **NinjaOne ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Add Script**, and paste the script contents.

Set the script variable `Homepage` to your organization‚Äôs homepage URL (e.g., `https://www.georgiastate.edu`).

---

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Currently, this project doesn‚Äôt include formal unit tests.  
You can manually verify correct application by checking browser policy pages:

### Edge
```
edge://policy
```
### Chrome
```
chrome://policy
```

You should see:
- `HomepageLocation`
- `RestoreOnStartup`
- `RestoreOnStartupURLs`

All showing ‚ÄúLoaded‚Äù with your configured URL.

---

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To apply the policy:
1. Deploy the PowerShell script through NinjaOne or run it locally as an Administrator.
2. The script writes registry policies to:
   - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge`
   - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome`
3. On next launch, both browsers will open to the homepage and display a managed ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button.

Example local execution:
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Set-Homepage.ps1 -Homepage "https://intranet.company.com"
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

1. In **NinjaOne**, go to **Policies ‚Üí Add Component**.  
2. Paste the script and configure:
   - **Run As:** System  
   - **Shell:** PowerShell (64-bit)  
   - **Triggers:** At Startup + Once ASAP  
3. Save and attach it to your workstation/server policies.  
4. Once deployed, the homepage setting will be enforced automatically for all users.

To revert, remove the registry keys under the same `Policies` paths.
